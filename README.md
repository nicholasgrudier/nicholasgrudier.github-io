# About me
## My Interests
- I like to ride horses and rope steers. I typically try to do this at least twice a month. I currently work at a ranch throwing hay on the weekends which gives me a chance to get out there more and spend time with the horses.
- My favorite video game since I was a child has always been *Super Smash Bros.*, made by Nintendo. This game is called a platform fighter because the goal of the game is to stay on the platform while fighting and not fall off of the stage.
- The gym is also my life, and I live to lift weights and get stronger. Currently at 225lb im looking to add another 20 pounds by my birthday in April,2024.
