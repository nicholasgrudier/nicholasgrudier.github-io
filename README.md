# About me
## My Interests
- I like to ride horses and rope steers. I typically try to do this at least twice a month.
- My favorite video game since I was a child has always been *Super Smash Bros.*, made by Nintendo.
- The gym is also my life, and I live to lift weights and get stronger.

## Websites I Recommend
- [roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/) - This site provides many different roadmaps in the tech industry and what you need to learn to land jobs in those fields. They also link to articles and resources within their roadmaps to help you find the information you need.
- [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/) - This site is amazing because it lets you reminisce on the old days of the internet. It can also be helpful to find information that others have taken down or lost to domain expiration.
